## Overview
InnoDrive is an autonomous driving project aimed at revolutionizing the driving landscape. Our inspiration stems from how unpredictable human driving is â€“ from safety concerns to wasted time at traffic lights. We envisioned a solution that solves these challenges, offering a safer, more efficient, and inclusive driving experience.

## How We Built It
We built InnoDrive with a combination of cutting-edge technologies, including AI-driven autonomous systems, GPS tracking, and robust sensor integration. The project involved the use of libraries like OpenCV and Jetson.GPIO in the code facilitated efficient image processing, control hardware, and real-time decision-making, contributing to the overall success of the project.

## Next Steps
The roadmap for InnoDrive involves an extensive focus on coding, with plans to refine and enhance the hardware prototype based on feedback from developers. An addition to the project would be including another camera module within the vehicle cabin. This module will monitor driver reactions, enabling the system to detect signs of drowsiness or sleepiness based on facial gestures.
